  "sleep": {
    "sectionTitle": "Sleep, Weight & Stress — What's the Connection?",
    "intro": "Sleep is critical to both physical and mental health. It affects concentration, memory, mood, the immune system, growth, metabolism, and emotional balance.",
    "lackOfSleep": "Lack of sleep can lead to attention problems, anxiety, depression, weight gain, cognitive impairment, and an increased risk of chronic illness.",
    "renewal": "Sleep allows the body and brain to renew themselves, perform metabolic \"cleaning,\" and create neural connections—processes that are essential for proper functioning.",
    "cyclesTitle": "Stages of Sleep — The Sleep Cycle",
    "cyclesIntro": "Each night includes 4–6 cycles, each consisting of the following stages:",
    "lightSleep": {
      "title": "Light Sleep (Stages 1–2)",
      "description": "The transition from wakefulness to sleep. Breathing and heart rate slow down, and body temperature drops. In Stage 2, the brain begins organizing memories and information from the day."
    },
    "deepSleep": {
      "title": "Deep Sleep (Stage 3)",
      "description": "This is the most restorative stage. The body releases growth hormone, builds muscle, repairs tissues, and strengthens the immune system. It is very difficult to wake up from this stage."
    },
    "remSleep": {
      "title": "REM Sleep (Dream Sleep)",
      "description": "The brain is highly active (similar to wakefulness), the eyes move rapidly beneath the eyelids, and the muscles are temporarily paralyzed so we do not physically act out our dreams. This stage is critical for emotional processing and memory consolidation."
    },
    "processesTitle": "Key Physiological Processes",
    "detox": {
      "title": "Brain \"Detoxification\"",
      "description": "Recent studies (as of 2026) continue to confirm that during sleep, the brain clears metabolic waste products that accumulate during the day—a process essential for preventing neurological diseases."
    },
    "hormones": {
      "title": "Hormonal Balance",
      "description": "The body balances hunger and satiety hormones (ghrelin and leptin). In addition, cortisol (the stress hormone) decreases at the beginning of the night and rises toward morning to help us wake up. Adenosine also plays an important role and contributes to feelings of fatigue."
    },
    "melatonin": "As preparation for sleep, the brain secretes melatonin (the \"darkness hormone\"), which is essential for sleep. During stress, cortisol levels rise and interfere with entering the sleep process.",
    "screenWarning": "Tired in front of screens and snacking? Think about what's happening to your body, your brain, and all the nightly cleansing processes that are being delayed and disrupted due to hormonal imbalance."
  },
  "aromatherapy": {
    "sectionTitle": "Aromatherapy Treatment",
    "intro": "As part of my treatments, I formulate aromatherapy essential oil formulas according to the patient's condition, such as oils, creams, ointments, or perfumes.",
    "benefits": "Aromatherapy has many health benefits (scientifically and research-proven) and works immediately due to the unique properties of essential oil extracts—through inhalation, massage, baths, soaking, and more.",
    "synergy": "Each oil has its own unique characteristics. When combined with other oils, the blend gains a different and special therapeutic effect. The synergy is personalized and varies from person to person and from treatment to treatment.",
    "results": "The effects are noticeable from the very first session—calmness, improved sleep, pain relief, and more—according to reports from patients.",
    "babies": "The oils are generally suitable for most of the population; however, for infants there are specific oils that can be used, such as chamomile, lavender, myrtle, eucalyptus radiata, and ravintsara.",
    "consultationRequired": "Use of essential oils is only after professional consultation!!",
    "warningsTitle": "Warnings",
    "warning1": "Oils must be used for massage or application only when diluted with carrier oils.",
    "warning2": "Pregnant women: not all oils are suitable.",
    "warning3": "Use caution with essential oils for older adults. Lower dosages should be considered. Just as medications remain in the body longer in older age, aromatherapy oils also take longer to be eliminated. Therefore, professional consultation is mandatory at every stage of use and purchase.",
    "purchaseWarning": "The topic of purchasing oils is no less important. I recommend buying only from sources recommended by professionals. Poor-quality oils can cause headaches, nausea, and more. Impure oils may not help at all.",
    "summary": "In summary: Aromatherapy oils can heal and assist in many conditions when used with proper guidance and professional consultation. On the other hand, incorrect use without guidance may not help and could even cause harm.",
    "aiDisclaimer": "One more thing: Today, with AI, anyone can ask questions and get answers—but please pay attention: AI can also make mistakes, and it does not replace consultation with a professional.",
    "medicalDisclaimer": "This treatment does not replace medical care.",
    "closing": "Enjoy, with the integration of aromatherapy."
